# Design Pattern

<sub>Heavily inspired (copied and pasted) from kamranahmedse's repo: [design-patterns-for-humans](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/design-patterns-for-humans)</sub>

Introduction
=================

Design patterns are solutions to recurring problems; **guidelines on how to tackle certain problems**. They are not classes, packages or libraries that you can plug into your application and wait for the magic to happen. These are, rather, guidelines on how to tackle certain problems in certain situations.

Types of Design Patterns
-----------------

* [Creational](#creational-design-patterns)
* [Structural](#structural-design-patterns)
* [Behavioral](#behavioral-design-patterns)

Creational Design Patterns
==========================

Creational patterns are focused towards how to instantiate an object or group of related objects.

 * [Simple Factory](#-simple-factory)
 * [Factory Method](#-factory-method)
 * [Abstract Factory](#-abstract-factory)
 * [Singleton](#-singleton)

Simple Factory
--------------
Real world example
> Consider, you are building a house and you need doors. You can either put on your carpenter clothes, bring some wood, glue, nails and all the tools required to build the door and start building it in your house or you can simply call the factory and get the built door delivered to you so that you don't need to learn anything about the door making or to deal with the mess that comes with making it.

In plain words
> Simple factory simply generates an instance for client without exposing any instantiation logic to the client

**Programmatic Example**

First of all we have a door interface and the implementation
```php
interface Door
{
    public function getWidth(): float;
    public function getHeight(): float;
}

class WoodenDoor implements Door
{
    protected $width;
    protected $height;

    public function __construct(float $width, float $height)
    {
        $this->width = $width;
        $this->height = $height;
    }

    public function getWidth(): float
    {
        return $this->width;
    }

    public function getHeight(): float
    {
        return $this->height;
    }
}
```
Then we have our door factory that makes the door and returns it
```php
class DoorFactory
{
    public static function makeDoor($width, $height): Door
    {
        return new WoodenDoor($width, $height);
    }
}
```
And then it can be used as
```php
// Make me a door of 100x200
$door = DoorFactory::makeDoor(100, 200);

echo 'Width: ' . $door->getWidth();
echo 'Height: ' . $door->getHeight();

// Make me a door of 50x100
$door2 = DoorFactory::makeDoor(50, 100);
```

**When to Use?**

When creating an object is not just a few assignments and involves some logic, it makes sense to put it in a dedicated factory instead of repeating the same code everywhere.

Factory Method
--------------

Real world example
> Consider the case of a hiring manager. It is impossible for one person to interview for each of the positions. Based on the job opening, she has to decide and delegate the interview steps to different people.

In plain words
> It provides a way to delegate the instantiation logic to child classes.

 **Programmatic Example**

Taking our hiring manager example above. First of all we have an interviewer interface and some implementations for it

```php
interface Interviewer
{
    public function askQuestions();
}

class Developer implements Interviewer
{
    public function askQuestions()
    {
        echo 'Asking about design patterns!';
    }
}

class CommunityExecutive implements Interviewer
{
    public function askQuestions()
    {
        echo 'Asking about community building';
    }
}
```

Now let us create our `HiringManager`

```php
abstract class HiringManager
{

    // Factory method
    abstract protected function makeInterviewer(): Interviewer;

    public function takeInterview()
    {
        $interviewer = $this->makeInterviewer();
        $interviewer->askQuestions();
    }
}

```
Now any child can extend it and provide the required interviewer
```php
class DevelopmentManager extends HiringManager
{
    protected function makeInterviewer(): Interviewer
    {
        return new Developer();
    }
}

class MarketingManager extends HiringManager
{
    protected function makeInterviewer(): Interviewer
    {
        return new CommunityExecutive();
    }
}
```
and then it can be used as

```php
$devManager = new DevelopmentManager();
$devManager->takeInterview(); // Output: Asking about design patterns

$marketingManager = new MarketingManager();
$marketingManager->takeInterview(); // Output: Asking about community building.
```

**When to use?**

Useful when there is some generic processing in a class but the required sub-class is dynamically decided at runtime. Or putting it in other words, when the client doesn't know what exact sub-class it might need.

Abstract Factory
----------------

Real world example
> Extending our door example from Simple Factory. Based on your needs you might get a wooden door from a wooden door shop, iron door from an iron shop or a PVC door from the relevant shop. Plus you might need a guy with different kind of specialities to fit the door, for example a carpenter for wooden door, welder for iron door etc. As you can see there is a dependency between the doors now, wooden door needs carpenter, iron door needs a welder etc.

In plain words
> A factory of factories; a factory that groups the individual but related/dependent factories together without specifying their concrete classes.

**Programmatic Example**

Translating the door example above. First of all we have our `Door` interface and some implementation for it

```php
interface Door
{
    public function getDescription();
}

class WoodenDoor implements Door
{
    public function getDescription()
    {
        echo 'I am a wooden door';
    }
}

class IronDoor implements Door
{
    public function getDescription()
    {
        echo 'I am an iron door';
    }
}
```
Then we have some fitting experts for each door type

```php
interface DoorFittingExpert
{
    public function getDescription();
}

class Welder implements DoorFittingExpert
{
    public function getDescription()
    {
        echo 'I can only fit iron doors';
    }
}

class Carpenter implements DoorFittingExpert
{
    public function getDescription()
    {
        echo 'I can only fit wooden doors';
    }
}
```

Now we have our abstract factory that would let us make family of related objects i.e. wooden door factory would create a wooden door and wooden door fitting expert and iron door factory would create an iron door and iron door fitting expert
```php
interface DoorFactory
{
    public function makeDoor(): Door;
    public function makeFittingExpert(): DoorFittingExpert;
}

// Wooden factory to return carpenter and wooden door
class WoodenDoorFactory implements DoorFactory
{
    public function makeDoor(): Door
    {
        return new WoodenDoor();
    }

    public function makeFittingExpert(): DoorFittingExpert
    {
        return new Carpenter();
    }
}

// Iron door factory to get iron door and the relevant fitting expert
class IronDoorFactory implements DoorFactory
{
    public function makeDoor(): Door
    {
        return new IronDoor();
    }

    public function makeFittingExpert(): DoorFittingExpert
    {
        return new Welder();
    }
}
```
And then it can be used as
```php
$woodenFactory = new WoodenDoorFactory();

$door = $woodenFactory->makeDoor();
$expert = $woodenFactory->makeFittingExpert();

$door->getDescription();  // Output: I am a wooden door
$expert->getDescription(); // Output: I can only fit wooden doors

// Same for Iron Factory
$ironFactory = new IronDoorFactory();

$door = $ironFactory->makeDoor();
$expert = $ironFactory->makeFittingExpert();

$door->getDescription();  // Output: I am an iron door
$expert->getDescription(); // Output: I can only fit iron doors
```

As you can see the wooden door factory has encapsulated the `carpenter` and the `wooden door` also iron door factory has encapsulated the `iron door` and `welder`. And thus it had helped us make sure that for each of the created door, we do not get a wrong fitting expert.   

**When to use?**

When there are interrelated dependencies with not-that-simple creation logic involved

Singleton
------------
Real world example
> There can only be one president of a country at a time. The same president has to be brought to action, whenever duty calls. President here is singleton.

In plain words
> Ensures that only one object of a particular class is ever created.

Singleton pattern is actually considered an anti-pattern and overuse of it should be avoided. It is not necessarily bad and could have some valid use-cases but should be used with caution because it introduces a global state in your application and change to it in one place could affect in the other areas and it could become pretty difficult to debug. The other bad thing about them is it makes your code tightly coupled plus mocking the singleton could be difficult.

**Programmatic Example**

To create a singleton, make the constructor private, disable cloning, disable extension and create a static variable to house the instance
```php
final class President
{
    private static $instance;

    private function __construct()
    {
        // Hide the constructor
    }

    public static function getInstance(): President
    {
        if (!self::$instance) {
            self::$instance = new self();
        }

        return self::$instance;
    }

    private function __clone()
    {
        // Disable cloning
    }

    private function __wakeup()
    {
        // Disable unserialize
    }
}
```
Then in order to use
```php
$president1 = President::getInstance();
$president2 = President::getInstance();

var_dump($president1 === $president2); // true
```

Structural Design Patterns
==========================
Structural patterns are mostly concerned with object composition or in other words how the entities can use each other. Or yet another explanation would be, they help in answering "How to build a software component?"

 * [Adapter](#-adapter)
 * [Bridge](#-bridge)
 * [Composite](#-composite)
 * [Decorator](#-decorator)
 * [Facade](#-facade)
 * [Proxy](#-proxy)

Adapter
-------
Real world example
> Consider that you have some pictures in your memory card and you need to transfer them to your computer. In order to transfer them you need some kind of adapter that is compatible with your computer ports so that you can attach memory card to your computer. In this case card reader is an adapter.
> Another example would be the famous power adapter; a three legged plug can't be connected to a two pronged outlet, it needs to use a power adapter that makes it compatible with the two pronged outlet.
> Yet another example would be a translator translating words spoken by one person to another

In plain words
> Adapter pattern lets you wrap an otherwise incompatible object in an adapter to make it compatible with another class.

**Programmatic Example**

Consider a game where there is a hunter and he hunts lions.

First we have an interface `Lion` that all types of lions have to implement

```php
interface Lion
{
    public function roar();
}

class AfricanLion implements Lion
{
    public function roar()
    {
    }
}

class AsianLion implements Lion
{
    public function roar()
    {
    }
}
```
And hunter expects any implementation of `Lion` interface to hunt.
```php
class Hunter
{
    public function hunt(Lion $lion)
    {
        $lion->roar();
    }
}
```

Now let's say we have to add a `WildDog` in our game so that hunter can hunt that also. But we can't do that directly because dog has a different interface. To make it compatible for our hunter, we will have to create an adapter that is compatible

```php
// This needs to be added to the game
class WildDog
{
    public function bark()
    {
    }
}

// Adapter around wild dog to make it compatible with our game
class WildDogAdapter implements Lion
{
    protected $dog;

    public function __construct(WildDog $dog)
    {
        $this->dog = $dog;
    }

    public function roar()
    {
        $this->dog->bark();
    }
}
```
And now the `WildDog` can be used in our game using `WildDogAdapter`.

```php
$wildDog = new WildDog();
$wildDogAdapter = new WildDogAdapter($wildDog);

$hunter = new Hunter();
$hunter->hunt($wildDogAdapter);
```

Bridge
------
Real world example
> Consider you have a website with different pages and you are supposed to allow the user to change the theme. What would you do? Create multiple copies of each of the pages for each of the themes or would you just create separate theme and load them based on the user's preferences? Bridge pattern allows you to do the second i.e.

![With and without the bridge pattern](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11269635/23065293/33b7aea0-f515-11e6-983f-98823c9845ee.png)

In Plain Words
> Bridge pattern is about preferring composition over inheritance. Implementation details are pushed from a hierarchy to another object with a separate hierarchy.

**Programmatic Example**

Translating our WebPage example from above. Here we have the `WebPage` hierarchy

```php
interface WebPage
{
    public function __construct(Theme $theme);
    public function getContent();
}

class About implements WebPage
{
    protected $theme;

    public function __construct(Theme $theme)
    {
        $this->theme = $theme;
    }

    public function getContent()
    {
        return "About page in " . $this->theme->getColor();
    }
}

class Careers implements WebPage
{
    protected $theme;

    public function __construct(Theme $theme)
    {
        $this->theme = $theme;
    }

    public function getContent()
    {
        return "Careers page in " . $this->theme->getColor();
    }
}
```
And the separate theme hierarchy
```php

interface Theme
{
    public function getColor();
}

class DarkTheme implements Theme
{
    public function getColor()
    {
        return 'Dark Black';
    }
}
class LightTheme implements Theme
{
    public function getColor()
    {
        return 'Off white';
    }
}
class AquaTheme implements Theme
{
    public function getColor()
    {
        return 'Light blue';
    }
}
```
And both the hierarchies
```php
$darkTheme = new DarkTheme();

$about = new About($darkTheme);
$careers = new Careers($darkTheme);

echo $about->getContent(); // "About page in Dark Black";
echo $careers->getContent(); // "Careers page in Dark Black";
```

Composite
-----------------

Real world example
> Every organization is composed of employees. Each of the employees has the same features i.e. has a salary, has some responsibilities, may or may not report to someone, may or may not have some subordinates etc.

In plain words
> Composite pattern lets clients treat the individual objects in a uniform manner.

**Programmatic Example**

Taking our employees example from above. Here we have different employee types

```php
interface Employee
{
    public function __construct(string $name, float $salary);
    public function getName(): string;
    public function setSalary(float $salary);
    public function getSalary(): float;
    public function getRoles(): array;
}

class Developer implements Employee
{
    protected $salary;
    protected $name;
    protected $roles;
    
    public function __construct(string $name, float $salary)
    {
        $this->name = $name;
        $this->salary = $salary;
    }

    public function getName(): string
    {
        return $this->name;
    }

    public function setSalary(float $salary)
    {
        $this->salary = $salary;
    }

    public function getSalary(): float
    {
        return $this->salary;
    }

    public function getRoles(): array
    {
        return $this->roles;
    }
}

class Designer implements Employee
{
    protected $salary;
    protected $name;
    protected $roles;

    public function __construct(string $name, float $salary)
    {
        $this->name = $name;
        $this->salary = $salary;
    }

    public function getName(): string
    {
        return $this->name;
    }

    public function setSalary(float $salary)
    {
        $this->salary = $salary;
    }

    public function getSalary(): float
    {
        return $this->salary;
    }

    public function getRoles(): array
    {
        return $this->roles;
    }
}
```

Then we have an organization which consists of several different types of employees

```php
class Organization
{
    protected $employees;

    public function addEmployee(Employee $employee)
    {
        $this->employees[] = $employee;
    }

    public function getNetSalaries(): float
    {
        $netSalary = 0;

        foreach ($this->employees as $employee) {
            $netSalary += $employee->getSalary();
        }

        return $netSalary;
    }
}
```

And then it can be used as

```php
// Prepare the employees
$john = new Developer('John Doe', 12000);
$jane = new Designer('Jane Doe', 15000);

// Add them to organization
$organization = new Organization();
$organization->addEmployee($john);
$organization->addEmployee($jane);

echo "Net salaries: " . $organization->getNetSalaries(); // Net Salaries: 27000
```

Decorator
-------------

Real world example

> Imagine you run a car service shop offering multiple services. Now how do you calculate the bill to be charged? You pick one service and dynamically keep adding to it the prices for the provided services till you get the final cost. Here each type of service is a decorator.

In plain words
> Decorator pattern lets you dynamically change the behavior of an object at run time by wrapping them in an object of a decorator class.

**Programmatic Example**

Lets take coffee for example. First of all we have a simple coffee implementing the coffee interface

```php
interface Coffee
{
    public function getCost();
    public function getDescription();
}

class SimpleCoffee implements Coffee
{
    public function getCost()
    {
        return 10;
    }

    public function getDescription()
    {
        return 'Simple coffee';
    }
}
```
We want to make the code extensible to allow options to modify it if required. Lets make some add-ons (decorators)
```php
class MilkCoffee implements Coffee
{
    protected $coffee;

    public function __construct(Coffee $coffee)
    {
        $this->coffee = $coffee;
    }

    public function getCost()
    {
        return $this->coffee->getCost() + 2;
    }

    public function getDescription()
    {
        return $this->coffee->getDescription() . ', milk';
    }
}

class WhipCoffee implements Coffee
{
    protected $coffee;

    public function __construct(Coffee $coffee)
    {
        $this->coffee = $coffee;
    }

    public function getCost()
    {
        return $this->coffee->getCost() + 5;
    }

    public function getDescription()
    {
        return $this->coffee->getDescription() . ', whip';
    }
}

class VanillaCoffee implements Coffee
{
    protected $coffee;

    public function __construct(Coffee $coffee)
    {
        $this->coffee = $coffee;
    }

    public function getCost()
    {
        return $this->coffee->getCost() + 3;
    }

    public function getDescription()
    {
        return $this->coffee->getDescription() . ', vanilla';
    }
}
```

Lets make a coffee now

```php
$someCoffee = new SimpleCoffee();
echo $someCoffee->getCost(); // 10
echo $someCoffee->getDescription(); // Simple Coffee

$someCoffee = new MilkCoffee($someCoffee);
echo $someCoffee->getCost(); // 12
echo $someCoffee->getDescription(); // Simple Coffee, milk

$someCoffee = new WhipCoffee($someCoffee);
echo $someCoffee->getCost(); // 17
echo $someCoffee->getDescription(); // Simple Coffee, milk, whip

$someCoffee = new VanillaCoffee($someCoffee);
echo $someCoffee->getCost(); // 20
echo $someCoffee->getDescription(); // Simple Coffee, milk, whip, vanilla
```

Facade
----------------

Real world example
> How do you turn on the computer? "Hit the power button" you say! That is what you believe because you are using a simple interface that computer provides on the outside, internally it has to do a lot of stuff to make it happen. This simple interface to the complex subsystem is a facade.

In plain words
> Facade pattern provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.

**Programmatic Example**

Taking our computer example from above. Here we have the computer class

```php
class Computer
{
    public function getElectricShock()
    {
        echo "Ouch!";
    }

    public function makeSound()
    {
        echo "Beep beep!";
    }

    public function showLoadingScreen()
    {
        echo "Loading..";
    }

    public function bam()
    {
        echo "Ready to be used!";
    }

    public function closeEverything()
    {
        echo "Bup bup bup buzzzz!";
    }

    public function sooth()
    {
        echo "Zzzzz";
    }

    public function pullCurrent()
    {
        echo "Haaah!";
    }
}
```
Here we have the facade
```php
class ComputerFacade
{
    protected $computer;

    public function __construct(Computer $computer)
    {
        $this->computer = $computer;
    }

    public function turnOn()
    {
        $this->computer->getElectricShock();
        $this->computer->makeSound();
        $this->computer->showLoadingScreen();
        $this->computer->bam();
    }

    public function turnOff()
    {
        $this->computer->closeEverything();
        $this->computer->pullCurrent();
        $this->computer->sooth();
    }
}
```
Now to use the facade
```php
$computer = new ComputerFacade(new Computer());
$computer->turnOn(); // Ouch! Beep beep! Loading.. Ready to be used!
$computer->turnOff(); // Bup bup buzzz! Haah! Zzzzz
```


Proxy
-------------------
Real world example
> Have you ever used an access card to go through a door? There are multiple options to open that door i.e. it can be opened either using access card or by pressing a button that bypasses the security. The door's main functionality is to open but there is a proxy added on top of it to add some functionality. Let me better explain it using the code example below.

In plain words
> Using the proxy pattern, a class represents the functionality of another class.

**Programmatic Example**

Taking our security door example from above. Firstly we have the door interface and an implementation of door

```php
interface Door
{
    public function open();
    public function close();
}

class LabDoor implements Door
{
    public function open()
    {
        echo "Opening lab door";
    }

    public function close()
    {
        echo "Closing the lab door";
    }
}
```
Then we have a proxy to secure any doors that we want
```php
class SecuredDoor
{
    protected $door;

    public function __construct(Door $door)
    {
        $this->door = $door;
    }

    public function open($password)
    {
        if ($this->authenticate($password)) {
            $this->door->open();
        } else {
            echo "Big no! It ain't possible.";
        }
    }

    public function authenticate($password)
    {
        return $password === '$ecr@t';
    }

    public function close()
    {
        $this->door->close();
    }
}
```
And here is how it can be used
```php
$door = new SecuredDoor(new LabDoor());
$door->open('invalid'); // Big no! It ain't possible.

$door->open('$ecr@t'); // Opening lab door
$door->close(); // Closing lab door
```
Yet another example would be some sort of data-mapper implementation. For example, I recently made an ODM (Object Data Mapper) for MongoDB using this pattern where I wrote a proxy around mongo classes while utilizing the magic method `__call()`. All the method calls were proxied to the original mongo class and result retrieved was returned as it is but in case of `find` or `findOne` data was mapped to the required class objects and the object was returned instead of `Cursor`.

Behavioral Design Patterns
==========================

It is concerned with assignment of responsibilities between the objects. What makes them different from structural patterns is they don't just specify the structure but also outline the patterns for message passing/communication between them. Or in other words, they assist in answering "How to run a behavior in software component?"

* [Chain of Responsibility](#-chain-of-responsibility)
* [Command](#-command)
* [Iterator](#-iterator)
* [Mediator](#-mediator)
* [Memento](#-memento)
* [Observer](#-observer)
* [Visitor](#-visitor)
* [Strategy](#-strategy)
* [State](#-state)
* [Template Method](#-template-method)

Chain of Responsibility
-----------------------

Real world example
> For example, you have three payment methods (`A`, `B` and `C`) setup in your account; each having a different amount in it. `A` has 100 USD, `B` has 300 USD and `C` having 1000 USD and the preference for payments is chosen as `A` then `B` then `C`. You try to purchase something that is worth 210 USD. Using Chain of Responsibility, first of all account `A` will be checked if it can make the purchase, if yes purchase will be made and the chain will be broken. If not, request will move forward to account `B` checking for amount if yes chain will be broken otherwise the request will keep forwarding till it finds the suitable handler. Here `A`, `B` and `C` are links of the chain and the whole phenomenon is Chain of Responsibility.

In plain words
> It helps building a chain of objects. Request enters from one end and keeps going from object to object till it finds the suitable handler.

**Programmatic Example**

Translating our account example above. First of all we have a base account having the logic for chaining the accounts together and some accounts

```php
abstract class Account
{
    protected $successor;
    protected $balance;

    public function setNext(Account $account)
    {
        $this->successor = $account;
    }

    public function pay(float $amountToPay)
    {
        if ($this->canPay($amountToPay)) {
            echo sprintf('Paid %s using %s' . PHP_EOL, $amountToPay, get_called_class());
        } elseif ($this->successor) {
            echo sprintf('Cannot pay using %s. Proceeding ..' . PHP_EOL, get_called_class());
            $this->successor->pay($amountToPay);
        } else {
            throw new Exception('None of the accounts have enough balance');
        }
    }

    public function canPay($amount): bool
    {
        return $this->balance >= $amount;
    }
}

class Bank extends Account
{
    protected $balance;

    public function __construct(float $balance)
    {
        $this->balance = $balance;
    }
}

class Paypal extends Account
{
    protected $balance;

    public function __construct(float $balance)
    {
        $this->balance = $balance;
    }
}

class Bitcoin extends Account
{
    protected $balance;

    public function __construct(float $balance)
    {
        $this->balance = $balance;
    }
}
```

Now let's prepare the chain using the links defined above (i.e. Bank, Paypal, Bitcoin)

```php
// Let's prepare a chain like below
//      $bank->$paypal->$bitcoin
//
// First priority bank
//      If bank can't pay then paypal
//      If paypal can't pay then bit coin

$bank = new Bank(100);          // Bank with balance 100
$paypal = new Paypal(200);      // Paypal with balance 200
$bitcoin = new Bitcoin(300);    // Bitcoin with balance 300

$bank->setNext($paypal);
$paypal->setNext($bitcoin);

// Let's try to pay using the first priority i.e. bank
$bank->pay(259);

// Output will be
// ==============
// Cannot pay using bank. Proceeding ..
// Cannot pay using paypal. Proceeding ..:
// Paid 259 using Bitcoin!
```

Command
-------

Real world example
> A generic example would be you ordering food at a restaurant. You (i.e. `Client`) ask the waiter (i.e. `Invoker`) to bring some food (i.e. `Command`) and waiter simply forwards the request to Chef (i.e. `Receiver`) who has the knowledge of what and how to cook.
> Another example would be you (i.e. `Client`) switching on (i.e. `Command`) the television (i.e. `Receiver`) using a remote control (`Invoker`).

In plain words
> Allows you to encapsulate actions in objects. The key idea behind this pattern is to provide the means to decouple client from receiver.

**Programmatic Example**

First of all we have the receiver that has the implementation of every action that could be performed
```php
// Receiver
class Bulb
{
    public function turnOn()
    {
        echo "Bulb has been lit";
    }

    public function turnOff()
    {
        echo "Darkness!";
    }
}
```
then we have an interface that each of the commands are going to implement and then we have a set of commands
```php
interface Command
{
    public function execute();
    public function undo();
    public function redo();
}

// Command
class TurnOn implements Command
{
    protected $bulb;

    public function __construct(Bulb $bulb)
    {
        $this->bulb = $bulb;
    }

    public function execute()
    {
        $this->bulb->turnOn();
    }

    public function undo()
    {
        $this->bulb->turnOff();
    }

    public function redo()
    {
        $this->execute();
    }
}

class TurnOff implements Command
{
    protected $bulb;

    public function __construct(Bulb $bulb)
    {
        $this->bulb = $bulb;
    }

    public function execute()
    {
        $this->bulb->turnOff();
    }

    public function undo()
    {
        $this->bulb->turnOn();
    }

    public function redo()
    {
        $this->execute();
    }
}
```
Then we have an `Invoker` with whom the client will interact to process any commands
```php
// Invoker
class RemoteControl
{
    public function submit(Command $command)
    {
        $command->execute();
    }
}
```
Finally let's see how we can use it in our client
```php
$bulb = new Bulb();

$turnOn = new TurnOn($bulb);
$turnOff = new TurnOff($bulb);

$remote = new RemoteControl();
$remote->submit($turnOn); // Bulb has been lit!
$remote->submit($turnOff); // Darkness!
```

Command pattern can also be used to implement a transaction based system. Where you keep maintaining the history of commands as soon as you execute them. If the final command is successfully executed, all good otherwise just iterate through the history and keep executing the `undo` on all the executed commands.

Iterator
--------

Real world example
> An old radio set will be a good example of iterator, where user could start at some channel and then use next or previous buttons to go through the respective channels. Or take an example of MP3 player or a TV set where you could press the next and previous buttons to go through the consecutive channels or in other words they all provide an interface to iterate through the respective channels, songs or radio stations.  

In plain words
> It presents a way to access the elements of an object without exposing the underlying presentation.

**Programmatic example**

In PHP it is quite easy to implement using SPL (Standard PHP Library). Translating our radio stations example from above. First of all we have `RadioStation`

```php
class RadioStation
{
    protected $frequency;

    public function __construct(float $frequency)
    {
        $this->frequency = $frequency;
    }

    public function getFrequency(): float
    {
        return $this->frequency;
    }
}
```
Then we have our iterator

```php
use Countable;
use Iterator;

class StationList implements Countable, Iterator
{
    /** @var RadioStation[] $stations */
    protected $stations = [];

    /** @var int $counter */
    protected $counter;

    public function addStation(RadioStation $station)
    {
        $this->stations[] = $station;
    }

    public function removeStation(RadioStation $toRemove)
    {
        $toRemoveFrequency = $toRemove->getFrequency();
        $this->stations = array_filter($this->stations, function (RadioStation $station) use ($toRemoveFrequency) {
            return $station->getFrequency() !== $toRemoveFrequency;
        });
    }

    public function count(): int
    {
        return count($this->stations);
    }

    public function current(): RadioStation
    {
        return $this->stations[$this->counter];
    }

    public function key()
    {
        return $this->counter;
    }

    public function next()
    {
        $this->counter++;
    }

    public function rewind()
    {
        $this->counter = 0;
    }

    public function valid(): bool
    {
        return isset($this->stations[$this->counter]);
    }
}
```
And then it can be used as
```php
$stationList = new StationList();

$stationList->addStation(new RadioStation(89));
$stationList->addStation(new RadioStation(101));
$stationList->addStation(new RadioStation(102));
$stationList->addStation(new RadioStation(103.2));

foreach($stationList as $station) {
    echo $station->getFrequency() . PHP_EOL;
}

$stationList->removeStation(new RadioStation(89)); // Will remove station 89
```

Mediator
========

Real world example
> A general example would be when you talk to someone on your mobile phone, there is a network provider sitting between you and them and your conversation goes through it instead of being directly sent. In this case network provider is mediator.

In plain words
> Mediator pattern adds a third party object (called mediator) to control the interaction between two objects (called colleagues). It helps reduce the coupling between the classes communicating with each other. Because now they don't need to have the knowledge of each other's implementation.

**Programmatic Example**

Here is the simplest example of a chat room (i.e. mediator) with users (i.e. colleagues) sending messages to each other.

First of all, we have the mediator i.e. the chat room

```php
interface ChatRoomMediator 
{
    public function showMessage(User $user, string $message);
}

// Mediator
class ChatRoom implements ChatRoomMediator
{
    public function showMessage(User $user, string $message)
    {
        $time = date('M d, y H:i');
        $sender = $user->getName();

        echo $time . '[' . $sender . ']:' . $message;
    }
}
```

Then we have our users i.e. colleagues
```php
class User {
    protected $name;
    protected $chatMediator;

    public function __construct(string $name, ChatRoomMediator $chatMediator) {
        $this->name = $name;
        $this->chatMediator = $chatMediator;
    }

    public function getName() {
        return $this->name;
    }

    public function send($message) {
        $this->chatMediator->showMessage($this, $message);
    }
}
```
And the usage
```php
$mediator = new ChatRoom();

$john = new User('John Doe', $mediator);
$jane = new User('Jane Doe', $mediator);

$john->send('Hi there!');
$jane->send('Hey!');

// Output will be
// Feb 14, 10:58 [John]: Hi there!
// Feb 14, 10:58 [Jane]: Hey!
```

Memento
-------
Real world example
> Take the example of calculator (i.e. originator), where whenever you perform some calculation the last calculation is saved in memory (i.e. memento) so that you can get back to it and maybe get it restored using some action buttons (i.e. caretaker).

In plain words
> Memento pattern is about capturing and storing the current state of an object in a manner that it can be restored later on in a smooth manner.

Usually useful when you need to provide some sort of undo functionality.

**Programmatic Example**

Lets take an example of text editor which keeps saving the state from time to time and that you can restore if you want.

First of all we have our memento object that will be able to hold the editor state

```php
class EditorMemento
{
    protected $content;

    public function __construct(string $content)
    {
        $this->content = $content;
    }

    public function getContent()
    {
        return $this->content;
    }
}
```

Then we have our editor i.e. originator that is going to use memento object

```php
class Editor
{
    protected $content = '';

    public function type(string $words)
    {
        $this->content = $this->content . ' ' . $words;
    }

    public function getContent()
    {
        return $this->content;
    }

    public function save()
    {
        return new EditorMemento($this->content);
    }

    public function restore(EditorMemento $memento)
    {
        $this->content = $memento->getContent();
    }
}
```

And then it can be used as

```php
$editor = new Editor();

// Type some stuff
$editor->type('This is the first sentence.');
$editor->type('This is second.');

// Save the state to restore to : This is the first sentence. This is second.
$saved = $editor->save();

// Type some more
$editor->type('And this is third.');

// Output: Content before Saving
echo $editor->getContent(); // This is the first sentence. This is second. And this is third.

// Restoring to last saved state
$editor->restore($saved);

$editor->getContent(); // This is the first sentence. This is second.
```

Observer
--------
Real world example
> A good example would be the job seekers where they subscribe to some job posting site and they are notified whenever there is a matching job opportunity.   

In plain words
> Defines a dependency between objects so that whenever an object changes its state, all its dependents are notified.

**Programmatic example**

Translating our example from above. First of all we have job seekers that need to be notified for a job posting
```php
class JobPost
{
    protected $title;

    public function __construct(string $title)
    {
        $this->title = $title;
    }

    public function getTitle()
    {
        return $this->title;
    }
}

class JobSeeker implements Observer
{
    protected $name;

    public function __construct(string $name)
    {
        $this->name = $name;
    }

    public function onJobPosted(JobPost $job)
    {
        // Do something with the job posting
        echo 'Hi ' . $this->name . '! New job posted: '. $job->getTitle();
    }
}
```
Then we have our job postings to which the job seekers will subscribe
```php
class EmploymentAgency implements Observable
{
    protected $observers = [];

    protected function notify(JobPost $jobPosting)
    {
        foreach ($this->observers as $observer) {
            $observer->onJobPosted($jobPosting);
        }
    }

    public function attach(Observer $observer)
    {
        $this->observers[] = $observer;
    }

    public function addJob(JobPost $jobPosting)
    {
        $this->notify($jobPosting);
    }
}
```
Then it can be used as
```php
// Create subscribers
$johnDoe = new JobSeeker('John Doe');
$janeDoe = new JobSeeker('Jane Doe');

// Create publisher and attach subscribers
$jobPostings = new EmploymentAgency();
$jobPostings->attach($johnDoe);
$jobPostings->attach($janeDoe);

// Add a new job and see if subscribers get notified
$jobPostings->addJob(new JobPost('Software Engineer'));

// Output
// Hi John Doe! New job posted: Software Engineer
// Hi Jane Doe! New job posted: Software Engineer
```

Visitor
-------
Real world example
> Consider someone visiting Dubai. They just need a way (i.e. visa) to enter Dubai. After arrival, they can come and visit any place in Dubai on their own without having to ask for permission or to do some leg work in order to visit any place here; just let them know of a place and they can visit it. Visitor pattern lets you do just that, it helps you add places to visit so that they can visit as much as they can without having to do any legwork.

In plain words
> Visitor pattern lets you add further operations to objects without having to modify them.

**Programmatic example**

Let's take an example of a zoo simulation where we have several different kinds of animals and we have to make them Sound. Let's translate this using visitor pattern

```php
// Visitee
interface Animal
{
    public function accept(AnimalOperation $operation);
}

// Visitor
interface AnimalOperation
{
    public function visitMonkey(Monkey $monkey);
    public function visitLion(Lion $lion);
    public function visitDolphin(Dolphin $dolphin);
}
```
Then we have our implementations for the animals
```php
class Monkey implements Animal
{
    public function shout()
    {
        echo 'Ooh oo aa aa!';
    }

    public function accept(AnimalOperation $operation)
    {
        $operation->visitMonkey($this);
    }
}

class Lion implements Animal
{
    public function roar()
    {
        echo 'Roaaar!';
    }

    public function accept(AnimalOperation $operation)
    {
        $operation->visitLion($this);
    }
}

class Dolphin implements Animal
{
    public function speak()
    {
        echo 'Tuut tuttu tuutt!';
    }

    public function accept(AnimalOperation $operation)
    {
        $operation->visitDolphin($this);
    }
}
```
Let's implement our visitor
```php
class Speak implements AnimalOperation
{
    public function visitMonkey(Monkey $monkey)
    {
        $monkey->shout();
    }

    public function visitLion(Lion $lion)
    {
        $lion->roar();
    }

    public function visitDolphin(Dolphin $dolphin)
    {
        $dolphin->speak();
    }
}
```

And then it can be used as
```php
$monkey = new Monkey();
$lion = new Lion();
$dolphin = new Dolphin();

$speak = new Speak();

$monkey->accept($speak);    // Ooh oo aa aa!    
$lion->accept($speak);      // Roaaar!
$dolphin->accept($speak);   // Tuut tutt tuutt!
```
We could have done this simply by having an inheritance hierarchy for the animals but then we would have to modify the animals whenever we would have to add new actions to animals. But now we will not have to change them. For example, let's say we are asked to add the jump behavior to the animals, we can simply add that by creating a new visitor i.e.

```php
class Jump implements AnimalOperation
{
    public function visitMonkey(Monkey $monkey)
    {
        echo 'Jumped 20 feet high! on to the tree!';
    }

    public function visitLion(Lion $lion)
    {
        echo 'Jumped 7 feet! Back on the ground!';
    }

    public function visitDolphin(Dolphin $dolphin)
    {
        echo 'Walked on water a little and disappeared';
    }
}
```
And for the usage
```php
$jump = new Jump();

$monkey->accept($speak);   // Ooh oo aa aa!
$monkey->accept($jump);    // Jumped 20 feet high! on to the tree!

$lion->accept($speak);     // Roaaar!
$lion->accept($jump);      // Jumped 7 feet! Back on the ground!

$dolphin->accept($speak);  // Tuut tutt tuutt!
$dolphin->accept($jump);   // Walked on water a little and disappeared
```

Strategy
--------

Real world example
> Consider the example of sorting, we implemented bubble sort but the data started to grow and bubble sort started getting very slow. In order to tackle this we implemented Quick sort. But now although the quick sort algorithm was doing better for large datasets, it was very slow for smaller datasets. In order to handle this we implemented a strategy where for small datasets, bubble sort will be used and for larger, quick sort.

In plain words
> Strategy pattern allows you to switch the algorithm or strategy based upon the situation.

**Programmatic example**

Translating our example from above. First of all we have our strategy interface and different strategy implementations

```php
interface SortStrategy
{
    public function sort(array $dataset): array;
}

class BubbleSortStrategy implements SortStrategy
{
    public function sort(array $dataset): array
    {
        echo "Sorting using bubble sort";

        // Do sorting
        return $dataset;
    }
}

class QuickSortStrategy implements SortStrategy
{
    public function sort(array $dataset): array
    {
        echo "Sorting using quick sort";

        // Do sorting
        return $dataset;
    }
}
```

And then we have our client that is going to use any strategy
```php
class Sorter
{
    protected $sorter;

    public function __construct(SortStrategy $sorter)
    {
        $this->sorter = $sorter;
    }

    public function sort(array $dataset): array
    {
        return $this->sorter->sort($dataset);
    }
}
```
And it can be used as
```php
$dataset = [1, 5, 4, 3, 2, 8];

$sorter = new Sorter(new BubbleSortStrategy());
$sorter->sort($dataset); // Output : Sorting using bubble sort

$sorter = new Sorter(new QuickSortStrategy());
$sorter->sort($dataset); // Output : Sorting using quick sort
```

State
-----
Real world example
> Imagine you are using some drawing application, you choose the paint brush to draw. Now the brush changes its behavior based on the selected color i.e. if you have chosen red color it will draw in red, if blue then it will be in blue etc.  

In plain words
> It lets you change the behavior of a class when the state changes.

**Programmatic example**

Let's take an example of text editor, it lets you change the state of text that is typed i.e. if you have selected bold, it starts writing in bold, if italic then in italics etc.

First of all we have our state interface and some state implementations

```php
interface WritingState
{
    public function write(string $words);
}

class UpperCase implements WritingState
{
    public function write(string $words)
    {
        echo strtoupper($words);
    }
}

class LowerCase implements WritingState
{
    public function write(string $words)
    {
        echo strtolower($words);
    }
}

class DefaultText implements WritingState
{
    public function write(string $words)
    {
        echo $words;
    }
}
```
Then we have our editor
```php
class TextEditor
{
    protected $state;

    public function __construct(WritingState $state)
    {
        $this->state = $state;
    }

    public function setState(WritingState $state)
    {
        $this->state = $state;
    }

    public function type(string $words)
    {
        $this->state->write($words);
    }
}
```
And then it can be used as
```php
$editor = new TextEditor(new DefaultText());

$editor->type('First line');

$editor->setState(new UpperCase());

$editor->type('Second line');
$editor->type('Third line');

$editor->setState(new LowerCase());

$editor->type('Fourth line');
$editor->type('Fifth line');

// Output:
// First line
// SECOND LINE
// THIRD LINE
// fourth line
// fifth line
```

Template Method
---------------

Real world example
> Suppose we are getting some house built. The steps for building might look like
> - Prepare the base of house
> - Build the walls
> - Add roof
> - Add other floors

> The order of these steps could never be changed i.e. you can't build the roof before building the walls etc but each of the steps could be modified for example walls can be made of wood or polyester or stone.

In plain words
> Template method defines the skeleton of how a certain algorithm could be performed, but defers the implementation of those steps to the children classes.

**Programmatic Example**

Imagine we have a build tool that helps us test, lint, build, generate build reports (i.e. code coverage reports, linting report etc) and deploy our app on the test server.

First of all we have our base class that specifies the skeleton for the build algorithm
```php
abstract class Builder
{

    // Template method
    final public function build()
    {
        $this->test();
        $this->lint();
        $this->assemble();
        $this->deploy();
    }

    abstract public function test();
    abstract public function lint();
    abstract public function assemble();
    abstract public function deploy();
}
```

Then we can have our implementations

```php
class AndroidBuilder extends Builder
{
    public function test()
    {
        echo 'Running android tests';
    }

    public function lint()
    {
        echo 'Linting the android code';
    }

    public function assemble()
    {
        echo 'Assembling the android build';
    }

    public function deploy()
    {
        echo 'Deploying android build to server';
    }
}

class IosBuilder extends Builder
{
    public function test()
    {
        echo 'Running ios tests';
    }

    public function lint()
    {
        echo 'Linting the ios code';
    }

    public function assemble()
    {
        echo 'Assembling the ios build';
    }

    public function deploy()
    {
        echo 'Deploying ios build to server';
    }
}
```
And then it can be used as

```php
$androidBuilder = new AndroidBuilder();
$androidBuilder->build();

// Output:
// Running android tests
// Linting the android code
// Assembling the android build
// Deploying android build to server

$iosBuilder = new IosBuilder();
$iosBuilder->build();

// Output:
// Running ios tests
// Linting the ios code
// Assembling the ios build
// Deploying ios build to server
```
