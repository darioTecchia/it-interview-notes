# UML

The __Unified Modeling Language__ (UML) is a general-purpose, developmental, 
modeling language in the field of software engineering that is intended to 
provide a standard way to visualize the design of a system.

UML 2 has many types of diagrams, which are divided into two categories. 
Some types represent structural information, and the rest represent general 
types of behavior, including a few that represent different aspects of 
interactions. These diagrams can be categorized hierarchically as shown in 
the following class diagram:

These diagrams may all contain comments or notes explaining usage, constraint, 
or intent.

## Structure Diagram
Structure diagrams represent the static aspects of the system. It emphasizes 
the things that must be present in the system being modeled. Since structure 
diagrams represent the structure, they are used extensively in documenting 
the software architecture of software systems. For example, the component 
diagram describes how a software system is split up into components and shows 
the dependencies among these components.

## Behavior diagrams
Behavior diagrams represent the dynamic aspect of the system. It emphasizes 
what must happen in the system being modeled. Since behavior diagrams 
illustrate the behavior of a system, they are used extensively to describe the 
functionality of software systems. As an example, the activity diagram 
describes the business and operational step-by-step activities of the 
components in a system.

## Interaction diagrams
Interaction diagrams, a subset of behavior diagrams, emphasize the flow of 
control and data among the things in the system being modeled. For example, 
the sequence diagram shows how objects communicate with each other regarding 
a sequence of messages.
