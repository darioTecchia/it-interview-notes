# Hash Table
In computing, a **hash table** (hash map) is a data 
structure which implements an *associative array* 
abstract data type, a structure that can *map keys 
to values*. A hash table uses a *hash function* to 
compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, 
from which the desired value can be found

Ideally, the hash function will assign each key to a 
unique bucket, but most hash table designs employ an 
imperfect hash function, which might cause hash 
collisions where the hash function generates the same
index for more than one key. Such collisions must be
accommodated in some way.

Hash collision resolved by separate chaining.

In computer science, a **graph** is an abstract data type 
that is meant to implement the undirected graph and 
directed graph concepts from mathematics, specifically
the field of graph theory

A graph data structure consists of a finite (and possibly 
mutable) set of vertices or nodes or points, together 
with a set of unordered pairs of these vertices for an 
undirected graph or a set of ordered pairs for a 
directed graph. These pairs are known as edges, arcs, 
or lines for an undirected graph and as arrows, 
directed edges, directed arcs, or directed lines 
for a directed graph. The vertices may be part of 
the graph structure, or may be external entities 
represented by integer indices or references.
